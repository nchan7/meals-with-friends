### General Assembly - Software Engineering Immersive Project 4: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express,js, React.js, Typescript, MongoDB, Mongoose
#### Check out a demo of the site here: 


## Introduction
Can't trust reviews online? Meals With Friends combines the best features of Facebook and Yelp to provide a platform that allows a user to increase his/her social network and food option at the same time. Only friends can see each other's posts. So you can be honest about what you're posting and you'll be able to make better decisions when you're looking for the next best restaurant.

## Project Requirements
This is the fourth and final project that will be incorporated as part of the portfolio of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. The goal is to combined all that we have learned in the course (HTML, CSS, Javasript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Typescript, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Authentication) into a full-stack web application that we can publish for the public. 


## Technical Requirements
The technical requirements for the app are as follows: 
* Use Django or Express to build an application backend
* Create an application using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of those models
* Create your own front-end! Put effort into your design!
* Add authentication/authorization to restrict access to appropriate users
    * OAuth or Token Auth
* Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
* Deploy your application online so it's publicly accessible


## Development Process 
The development process followed a similar one as the previous projects which included planning and design phase, a research phase, and then a development phase. 

### Planning and Design 
Screenshots of the planning and design are shown below
